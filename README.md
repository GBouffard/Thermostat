:high_brightness: Thermostat :high_brightness:
===
This is me re-doing from scratch the Makers Academy Thermostat tutorial to learn about Javascript and JQuery.


- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- You can increase the temp with the up button
- You can decrease the temp with the down button
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default
- You can reset the temperature to 20 by hitting  the reset button
- The thermostat should colour the display based on energy usage - < 18 is green, < 25 is yellow, otherwise red
